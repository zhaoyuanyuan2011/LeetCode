Use i to iterate through all ending spaces, and use j to iterate through the first word it meets from the end.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        i = len(s)-1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
            i -= 1
        j = i
        while j >= 0 and s[j] != ' ':
            j -= 1
        return i-j
