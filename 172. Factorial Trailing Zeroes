Trailing zeros come from 10, and 10 comes from 2 x 5. There are always enough 2s.
So the key is that we need to count how many 5 + how many 5 x 5 + how many 5 x 5 x 5...
This can be done both interatively and recursively.

class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        while n > 0:
            ans += n // 5
            n //= 5
        return ans
