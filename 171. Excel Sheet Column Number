Similar to a decimal number, for each digit in the given string, we update by multiply it with 26 (instead of 10) and add the current digit. 
The current digit needs to be converted by the operation ord(char) - 64.

class Solution:
    def titleToNumber(self, s: str) -> int:
        ret = 0
        for char in s:
            ret = 26 * ret + ord(char) - 64
        return ret
